    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This package provide C++ structures with python bindings used to define and store contact phases and contact sequences. \n",
    "\n",
    "The classes defined by this package are able to store a wide variety of data related to the locomotion of legged robots. This classes can be efficiently serialized and used to share motions or any \"part\" of motion (eg. contact plan or centroidal reference) between frameworks and users. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this package, the different classes do not have access to any robot model and only store the data given by an user. There is nothing to check that the different data stored are consistent together or valid (eg. there could be a contact placement for a feet defined at a given time, but also a wholebody configuration defined for the same time where the feet is at a different position).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a couple of methods are available to check that part of the data are correctly defined, are continuous and/or have consistent time definition. See the last section of this notebook for more details. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main classes\n",
    "\n",
    "This package define 4 main classes representing physical concepts of legged locomotion. Contact Model, Contact Patch, Contact Phase and Contact Sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Contact Model define the physical properties of a contact. A Contact Patch define completely a contact between a part of the robot and the environment, it contain a Contact Model. A Contact Phase is defined by a constant set of contacts, it contains one or more Contact Patches. Finally, a Contact Sequence is a sequence of Contact Phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contact Model\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A Contact Model define the physical properties of a contact: the type of contact (Planar or Point), the physical positions of the contact points with respect to the \"center\" of the contact, and the coefficient of friction for this contact. "
